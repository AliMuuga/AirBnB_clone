## 0x01 Overview

This collaborative project aims to develop a CLI for a custom vacation rentals platform, inspired by [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/).

The CLI serves as a command interpreter facilitating the management of object abstractions and their storage.

For a deeper understanding of the project's core concept.

The CLI performs the following key tasks:

* Create a new object
* Retrieve an object from a file
* Perform operations on objects
* Destroy an object
